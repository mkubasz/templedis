## Abstract:

This ADR proposes that this project will use Rust as the language to write our own Redis implementation.
## Decision:

I will use Rust as the language to write our own Redis implementation.

## Rationale:

There are several reasons why I chose Rust for this project:

- Memory safety: Rust is a memory-safe language, which means that it can guarantee that there will be no memory leaks or other memory errors. This is important for a Redis implementation, which is a high-performance system that needs to be able to handle a lot of data.
- Speed: Rust is a very fast language, which is important for a Redis implementation. Redis is a key-value store, and it needs to be able to quickly access and modify data. Rust can provide this performance without sacrificing safety.
- Concurrency: Rust is a concurrent language, which means that it can handle multiple tasks at the same time. This is important for a Redis implementation, which needs to be able to handle multiple concurrent connections.

## Consequences:

### Good: 

- The main consequence of choosing Rust for this project is that I will like to master in a Rust. 
- The next one will be to learn about more detailed async patterns

### Bad: 

- Still in Rust can be a lot of problems related with very low-level API of this language
- Async need to be implemented from scratch
